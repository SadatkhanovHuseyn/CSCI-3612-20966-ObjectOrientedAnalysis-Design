# Random Number Generator Statistics (JAVA)

## Project Overview
This project implements a Java program that generates random numbers using multiple built-in Java random number generators and analyzes the generated data using descriptive statistics.

The goal of the assignment is to compare the statistical behavior of different random number generation approaches as the sample size increases.

The program generates random double values in the range **[0, 1)** and computes the following statistics:
    -Sample size (n)
    -Mean
    -Sample standard deviation
    -Minimum value
    -Maxmum value
